## Questions / Answers

1) **Availability** of information means authorised users are capable of accessing the information.

2) **Confidentiality** means you are protecting your data from getting disclosed.

3) **Integrity** means the protection of data from modification by unknown users.

4) When integrity is lacking in a system, **data tampering** occurs.

5) If the recipient of a message has been satisfied with the identity of the sender, then the principle of **authentication** comes into picture.

6) **Non-repudiation** ensures that the sender of a message cannot later claim that the message was never sent.

7) **Anonymity** ensures that the recipient of a message cannot find out the identity of the sender.

8) **Privacy** deals with the protection of an individual’s information which is implemented while using the internet on any computer or personal device.

9) Primary objectives of cryptography:

CIA:

* Confidentiality - Only authorised recipient(s) should be able to extract message content
* Integrity - Determine if data was altered during transmissions / prevent altering
* Authentication - Identify and verify the sender

Additionally,

* Non-repudiation - Irrevocability of sender, can't later deny sending message
* Availability - Users have access to the resources
