# Introduction - What is interaction design? (IxD)

**IxD** Spans lots of fields - interface/interaction design, usability engineering, controls, interactive environments, etc.

Interaction Design can be anything that involves any sort of technology, and people.

*Definition*: "The design of interactive products that can support the way in which people communicate and interact in their everyday lives"

---

### Interaction Design Goals

* Easy to learn
* Effective to use
* Providing enjoyable user experience

5 characteristics of (interaction) design -

 1) Design involved changing situations by shaping and deploying artifiacts
 2) Design is about epxloring possible futures
 3) Design entails framing the "problem" in paralle with creating possible "solutions"
 4) Design involved thinking through sketching and other tangible representations
 5) Design addresses insturmental, technical, aesthetical,and ethical aspects throughout

 See: <https://www.theuncomfortable.com/> for intentionally unusable common objects.

### Purpose of This Course

By the end of the semester, develop a designer-ly eye toward visual technology -
an intuition/insight for how a user would interact with a visual product (and why there may be problems).

*Simplified*:
Interaction design is a way of thinking (and set of tools) that allows us to design for **people** using **technologies** to undertake activities in context.

This can apply to visual technolgies - people come in with assumptions, produced in certain ecosystems, understand how it will be used.

# 2a - what are affordances (and why should you care)

**Affordance** = the perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possible be used (Norman 1988).

i.e. the functionality the object provides: shoes afford wearing and protecting your feet when walking.

In order for the property to be an affordance, this property must also be evident to a user.

Common Affordances:

* Button - push
* Switch - flip
* Knob - rotate

(whereas a switch you push would probably need a sign - a 'signifier')

When affordances are taken advantage of, the user knows what to do just by looking -
you don't need a picture, label, instructions etc. (for simple things)

```
Perceptual Information
  \/
Yes  | False         Perceptible
     | Affordance    Affordance
     |
No   | Correct       Hidden
     | Rejection     Affordance
     -------------------------------
         No           Yes        < Affordance
```

e.g.

* a push door only with a flat push panel, *Perceptible Affordance*
* a push door with a pullable handle - *False Affordance* of pulling
* a door that requires an unlabelled switch being pushed to open - *Hidden Affordance* - functionality that exists but is not always known
* a door that can't be pulled and doesn't appear to be pullable - *Correct Rejection*

## Signifiers, Not Affordances

READING: <https://jnd.org/signifiers_not_affordances/>

A "signifier" is some sort of indicator, some signal in the physical or social world that can be interpreted meaningfully. Signifiers signify critical information, even if the signifier itself is an accidental byproduct of the world.

>I call any physically perceivable cue a signifier, whether it is incidental or deliberate. A social signifier is one that is either created or interpreted by people or society, signifying social activity or appropriate social behavior. Thus, although there are many possible signifiers of wind speed and direction, including flags, the movement of grasses or tree leaves, or traveling debris, if the signifier is a flag, it is also a social signifier, for it had to be placed in its location by people, presumably for a reason (which may have nothing to do with providing an indication of the wind).


> Social signifiers replace affordances, for they are broader and richer, allowing for accidental signifiers as well as deliberate ones, and even for items that signify by their absence, as the lack of crowds on a train platform. The perceivable part of an affordance is a signifier, and if deliberately placed by a designer, it is a social signifier.

# 2b - Affordances vs Signifiers

* Signifier - e.g. a sign to explain what to do (because the affordances are confusing)
* Affordance - e.g. a handle to grasp, even if the door is 'PUSH' as given by signifier

Another example:

* affordance - a slider on a public toilet door lock
* signifier - icons showing locked/unlocked states (required to give the affordance meaning)

Affordances describe what actinos COULD be possible
Signifiers specify how people discover those possibilities: signs, perceptible signals of what can be done.

Signifiers are of **far more importance** to designers than affordances

---

"How users can discover what actinos are possible":

The perceivable part of an affordance is a signifier, and if deliberately places by a designer then it is a social signifier.

### Accidental Signifiers

An emergent but un-intentional signifier that does provide some information - e.g., a bookmark also signifies how much of the book is left which may aid in the enjoyment of the story.

## Interim quiz (due 1 october)

1)
   * <....> specify how people discover possibilities: <....> are perceptible signals of what can be done.  -  SIGNIFIERS
   * <....> are the properties of the system that determine how a thing could be possibly used.  -- Affordances

2) Perceivable part of an affordance is a signifier. -- TRUE

3) Think back to the famous example of the door ... Example of a door with handle bar from both sides

   * The Pull sticker on the door is a .... **signifier**

   * The problem with the handlebar on the door is that it is, in some respects, a ... **false affordace**

   * The handlebar on the door however also serves as a .... **perceptible affordance**

# Lecture 3 -- Introduction to user-centered design + case study

How do we get a design **right**? Rather than only knowing when it's wrong

Various Human/User centered design definitons:

* *International Standards (ISO 92410219:2019)* - An approach to system design/developments that aims to make interactive systems more usable, by focusing on the use of the system and applying human factors/ergonomics and usability knowledges and techniques.

* *Interaction design foundation*:
User-centered (UCD) is an iterative design process, in which designers focus on the users and their needs in each phase of the design process.
Users are involved with the design team throught the design process, via variety of research and design techniques - to create highly usable and accessible products.

### Models of the design process

**ISO 9241**:

Plan the human centred design process -->

Iterate:

* --> Understand and specify the context of use
* --> Specify user requirement
* --> produce design solutions to meet user requirements
* --> Evaluate the designs against requirements

--> Designed solution meets user requirements!

**IDO**:

`Inspirations -> Ideation -> Implementation`

How do I start? How do I interpret what I've learned, and prototype? How do I make my concept real and assess whether it's working?

**Design thinking (5-phase) model** -

* Empathise  - User's needs and problems
* Define  - Anaylse your observations, to define the problem
* Ideate  - think of solutions to each aspect of the problem
* Prototype  - devleop solution prototype for each aspect of the problem
* Test  - test the product using the best soltuoins identited

Case study for design thinkings - 'smart toys'

How can we support children in learning to cope with negative emotions?

Project (Research) -> Prototypes -> Product

**Problem**: Children  mental health gap

**Challenge**: current delivery mechanisms are insufficient (in-person), trying to teach experiential skills outside of context which they're applied (like telling someone how to ride a bike)

* Empathise: Understand users needs and problems -
'how to build systems to support and regulate children's emotions in the moment when they need this (as opposed to during irrelevant times)'

* Define: Takes data, and analyses it.
Rigorous research methods, Interviews and observations.

* Ideate: Mood boards - how could it look? What is the functionality of the object, drats and iterations of design. Interaction model, why it's benifical, etc.

* Prototype:
Taking the ideas, and putting them into a physical (or implemented) object - develop a solution from the ideas

* Test:
Test the product using the best solutions identified.
Listen to responses - from kids and parents in this case
