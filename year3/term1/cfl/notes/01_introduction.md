## Why study compilers

* **Growing Hardware Complexity** -
Not just increasing clock speed on processors: multiple cores, vector units, crypto accelerators.
DSPs, GPUs, ARM big.LITTLE, etc.

* **Safety and Security** -
Lots of security disasters associated with critical applications and low level languages.
For new code, we want to write in safer and higher-level languages (e.g. to avoid bad memory allocation), while still compiling to safe & optimised assembly.

## Definitions & Examples

#### Inductive definition of basic regular expressions

```
r  ::=  0      nothing
     |  1      empty string / "" / []
     |  c      character
     |  r‚ÇÅ+r‚ÇÇ  alternative / choice
     |  r‚ÇÅ.r‚ÇÇ  sequence
     |  r*     star (zero or more)
```

#### Familiar regular expressions

email address: /`[a-z0-9_\.-]+@[a-z0-9\.-]+.[a-z\.]{2,6}`/

```re
COMMON REGEX NOTATION:
\               escape following char (e.g. \. or \\)
^               match at start of string
$               match at end of string
r*              matches 0 or more times
r+              matches 1 or more times
r?              matches 0 or 1 times
r{n}            matches exactly n times
r{n,m}          matches at least n and at most m times
[...]           matches any single character inside brackets
[^...]          matches any single character not inside brackets
a-z A-Z 0-9     character ranges (e.g. [a-z]: 'any lowercase letter in the alphabet')
\d              any digit (i.e. [0-9])
\s              any whitespace character ' ', '\t', etc.
\b              word boundary
.               matches any character except newline '\n'
(r)             capturing group - groups expressions and remembers matches text
```

#### Evil Regular Expressions

Seemingly innocent examples: `(a*)*b` and `[a?]{n}[a]{n}`.
Try matching these on strings with the form:
`a, aa, aaa, aaaa, aaaaa, a...a, a^n`

In common programming language implementations [Python, Ruby, Java 8], matching time grows exponentially with input size (n).

e.g. for `(a*)*b`:

```
t    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
i  30‚îÇ                                  *    ‚îÇ
m    ‚îÇ                                  *    ‚îÇ
e  25‚îÇ                           Python *    ‚îÇ
     ‚îÇ                                  *    ‚îÇ
i  20‚îÇ                                 *     ‚îÇ
n    ‚îÇ                                 *     ‚îÇ
   15‚îÇ                                 *     ‚îÇ
s    ‚îÇ                                 *     ‚îÇ
e  10‚îÇ                                *      ‚îÇ
c    ‚îÇ                               *       ‚îÇ
o   5‚îÇ                             **        ‚îÇ
n    ‚îÇ                          ***          ‚îÇ
d   0*---*-----*------*--*-*****             ‚îÇ (input size)
s    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò n
     0   5    10    15    20    25    30   35
```

*Next Lecture* (`2, Regular Expressions & Derivatives`) we will show how to implement this such that a match can be completed in under 5 seconds for even values of `n` > `4x10^6`.

#### Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS)

This is a problem for code editors, forums, network intrusion detection systems, etc.

Also known as **Catastrophic Backtracking**, some examples:

```re
[a?]{n}[a]{n}
(a*)*b
([a‚Äêz]+)*
(a+aa)*
(a+a?)*
```

(<https://vimeo.com/112065252>)

Real world example (Cloudflare): <https://blog.cloudflare.com/details-of-the-cloudflare-outage-on-july-2-2019/>
guilty expression:

```re
?:(?:\"|'|\]|\}|\\|\d|(?:nan|infinity|true|false|null|undefined|symbol|math)|\`|\-|\+)+[)]*;?((?:\s|-|~|!|{}|\|\||\+)*.*(?:.*=.*)))
```

#### Languages and Strings

**Strings** are just lists of characters, e.g. "hello" / `[h,e,l,l,o]` / *hello*
The empty string: `[]`, or `""` acts as the additive identity (like 0 for natural/whole numbers).

**Languages** are sets of strings, e.g. `{[], hello, foobar, a, abc}`

**Concatenation of Strings and Languages**

String Concatenation: `s‚ÇÅ @ s‚ÇÇ`:

* `foo @ bar = foobar`
* `baz @ [] = baz`

Language Concatenation: `L‚ÇÅ @ L‚ÇÇ`:

`A @ B` ‚â° `{s‚ÇÅ @ s‚ÇÇ | s‚ÇÅ ‚àä A  ^  s‚ÇÅ ‚àä B}`
(`‚â°` or `‚âù` signifies an identity, equal to by definition)

The concatenation of two languages `A` and `B` is the set of all strings `s‚ÇÅ@s‚ÇÇ` where `s‚ÇÅ‚àäA` and `s‚ÇÅ‚àäB`.
This means `A@B` consists of all possible strings formed by pairing one string from `A` with another from `B`.

Examples:

* `A@{[]} = A` (concat. Language of only empty string '[]' - additive identity)
* `A@‚àÖ    = ‚àÖ` (concat. Empty Language '‚àÖ')
* `A = {hello} and B = {world}, A@B = {helloworld}`
and with languages including empty string `[]`:
* `A = {[], hello} and B = {[], world}, A@B = {hello, world, helloworld}`

If the two given languages are regular, the resulting language is also regular.

#### Meaning & Matching

**The meaning of a regex (expression language definitions)**:

Behind the scenes, regular expressions are trees!

```re
L(0)     ‚â° {}
L(1)     ‚â° {[]}
L(c)     ‚â° {[c]}
L(r‚ÇÅ+r‚ÇÇ) ‚â° L(r‚ÇÅ) ‚à™ L(r‚ÇÇ)
L(r‚ÇÅ¬∑r‚ÇÇ) ‚â° {s‚ÇÅ@s‚ÇÇ | s‚ÇÅ ‚àä L(r‚ÇÅ) ^ s‚ÇÇ ‚àä L(r‚ÇÇ)}
L(r*)    ‚â° ùñ¥[0<=n] L(r)‚Åø
L(r)‚Å∞    ‚â° {[]}
L(r)‚Åø‚Å∫¬π  ‚â° L(r) @ L(r)‚Åø
         ... (append on sets)  {s‚ÇÅ@s‚ÇÇ | s‚ÇÅ ‚àä L(r) ^ s‚ÇÇ ‚àä L(r)‚Åø}
```

(See [*Operators*](#operators) below)

**The meaning of matching**:

A regular expression `r` matches a string `s` provided: `s ‚àà L(r)`
i.e. if string 's' is a member of the language of the regular expression 'r', then r matches s.

*Lecture 2* aims to solving this problem of matching, as fast as possible!

#### Operators

Good reference guide (Union, Concatenation, Kleene Closure): <https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs373/sp2013/Lectures/lec06.pdf>

##### Standard operations

* `‚à™` Union, `L‚ÇÅ ‚à™ L‚ÇÇ` - The set of all strings contained in either (or both) language(s).
* `‚à©` Intersection, `L‚ÇÅ ‚à© L‚ÇÇ` - The set of all strings found only in both languages.
* `‚à©` Concatenation, `L‚ÇÅ @ L‚ÇÇ` - The set of all strings of the form ab, where a ‚àà L‚ÇÅ and b ‚àà L‚ÇÇ.

##### The Power Operation

The *n*th power of a language, is the concatenation of itself with its previous power:
*(where the base case `n=0` is the language `L(1)={[]}`, containing only the empty string)*

```re
A‚Å∞    ‚â°  {[]}
A‚Åø‚Å∫¬π  ‚â°  A @ A‚Åø
```

e.g. `A‚Å¥ = A @ A @ A @ A (@ {[]})`, `A¬π = A`, `A‚Å∞ = {[]}`
so `{a}‚Å¥ = {aaaa}` and `{a,b}¬≤ = {aa, ab, ba, bb}`

##### The Star Operation (Kleene Star)

The *Kleene Star* of a language:

`A* ‚â° ùñ¥[0<=n] A‚Åø` *(where `ùñ¥[0<=n]` denotes the union of all sets from 0 to n)*

expanding to:
`A‚Å∞ ùñ¥ A¬π ùñ¥ A¬≤ ùñ¥ A¬≥ ùñ¥ ...` or `{[]} ùñ¥ A ùñ¥ A@A ùñ¥ A@A@A ùñ¥ ...`

The Kleene star is an **idempotent unary operator**, i.e. `(A*)* = A*` for any set of strings or characters `A`.
*(The result of the operation is not affected when applied multiple times vs. once)*

#### Questions

 1) Q) Say `A = {[a], [b], [c], [d]}` - How many strings are in `A‚Å¥`?
    A)
     * `|A@A|` = `4^2` = 16
     * `|A@A@A|` = `4^2 x 4` = `4^3` = 64
     * `|A@A@A@A|` = `4^3 x 4` = `4^4` = 256
    => `A‚Å¥` has 256 strings

 2) Q) What if `A = {[a], [b], [c], []}`?
    A) 208

 3) Corner cases: `A @ {[]} = ?` and `A @ {} = ?`
    (See [*Languages & Strings*](#languages-and-strings) above)
    * `A @ {[]} = A`
    * `A @ {} = {}`
